There are mathematical algorithms for operating with "big" numbers (number that don't fit in 64-bit register).

# Laba1-4
Code of my labs in SROM
Some comments
*numbers in my works are represented on basis of 2^32
*Input in hex (e.g. A = 3FFAB6F5A2EDE763F69744D4CB856D1C3C68A17DE0777F3E33628F8EB8EBB1A51819DF1)
*In Lab3 I chose m = 509, p(x) = x^509 + x^23 + x^3 + x^2 + 1. It's 17 variant. My variant 18 was absent in program-for-checking.
*In Lab4 I chose m = 173 (for the same reason).
